# Coding Agent Operating Mode

- Follow the current `SPEC.md` exactly; no opportunistic refactors or scope creep.
- Definition of done: every acceptance check in `SPEC.md` passes.
- Never print, log, or commit secrets, keys, or credentials.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs and iterative progress over large rewrites.
- Recommended workflow: create a fresh branch for each task to keep history clean.
